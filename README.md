# Student_Scores_Regressson-
Loading the CSV dataset 
we have one feature and one output, so it's a simple regression model
splitting the dataset to 80,20 training and testing respectively
Regressor object has been created.
fitting the training set to the regressor model, we have got around 96% accuracy
then pipeline using make pipeline and polynomial features with degree three has been created 
fit the data to the model after applying degree three polynomial
After evaluating the model again we got around 98% accuracy
